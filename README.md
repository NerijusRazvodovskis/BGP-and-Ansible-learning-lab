# BGP and Ansible learning lab

This repository provides a pre-configured Containerlab topology featuring 8 virtual machines running Ubuntu Generic VM. The environment is designed to facilitate BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) studies and is configured to install FRR (Free Range Routing) using Ansible for streamlined setup and automation.

## Key Features

* Seamless BGP Practice: A robust, quickly deployable setup to dive into BGP routing, peering configurations, and advanced BGP topics.
* Flexible Environment: Modify and expand the topology as needed to test complex network scenarios.
* Ansible Integration: Enhance your Ansible skills by automating network configurations and managing routing changes, providing dual-purpose learning in both network engineering and automation.

## Why Use This Topology?

This setup is perfect for network engineers and enthusiasts who want to build their expertise in BGP without the hassle of manual configuration. The integration of Ansible makes it ideal for training in network automation, enabling you to script configurations, automate installations, and maintain network consistency.
